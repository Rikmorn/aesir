## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: 3-layer architecture (Platform -> Integrations -> Agents)
- [v2.0]: Biome over ESLint/Prettier for speed
- [v2.0]: MCP for agent-integration communication (LLM calls only)
- [v2.0]: pino for logging, dotenv-flow for config
- [v2.0]: 13 smaller phases to avoid gaps experienced in v1
- [10-01]: --legacy-peer-deps for npm due to LangChain peer dependency conflicts
- [10-01]: Allow PascalCase for variables (Zod schemas) in Biome naming convention
- [10-01]: 49 Biome violations deferred for future cleanup (noNonNullAssertion, noExplicitAny)
- [10-02]: dotenv-flow with default_node_env: development to handle missing NODE_ENV
- [10-02]: Presence-only validation for secrets (.min(1), no format patterns)
- [10-02]: Dual export: env (raw vars) + config (typed nested object)
- [10-03]: Full project tsc --noEmit in pre-commit (staged-only type checking is fundamentally broken)
- [10-03]: Biome native --staged flag eliminates need for lint-staged
- [10-03]: .vscode/settings.json tracked in git for consistent team settings
- [10-04]: CLAUDE.md as comprehensive single file (251 lines)
- [10-04]: Cursor rules use .mdc format with frontmatter in .cursor/rules/ directory
- [11-01]: pnpm@9.15.0 as package manager (replaces yarn)
- [11-01]: TypeScript project references with composite builds
- [11-01]: Pre-commit hooks disabled during migration (re-enable in 11-04)
- [11-01]: Vitest projects mode for monorepo testing
- [11-02]: Layer dependencies encoded: common (leaf) -> platform -> integrations -> agents
- [11-02]: workspace:* protocol for internal dependencies
- [11-02]: Agents layer references integrations, not platform directly
- [11-03]: 129 TypeScript files migrated to 4 packages (common, platform, integrations, agents)
- [11-03]: src/ preserved as src_old/ for reference during import fixes
- [11-03]: Orphan files (phase-1.test.ts, old index.ts) moved to _legacy/ for review

### Pending Todos

1. **Run dev-agent container as non-root** (infrastructure)
   - File: `.planning/todos/pending/2026-01-19-dev-agent-container-root-user.md`

2. **Fix 49 Biome lint violations** (code quality)
   - 34 noNonNullAssertion, 8 noExplicitAny, 7 other
   - Track in: 10-01-SUMMARY.md Remaining Violations section

3. **Re-enable pre-commit hooks** (after 11-04)
   - Disabled during monorepo migration
   - Re-enable in 11-04-PLAN.md

4. **Review _legacy/ files** (code cleanup)
   - phase-1.test.ts - may need to move to agents integration tests
   - old index.ts - likely obsolete, can be deleted after verification

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v2.4 decisions:
- Separate Next.js dashboard service (not embedded in agent service)
- SSE for real-time (not WebSockets)
- Read-only Postgres access, no new tables
- Service layer abstraction as future API boundary
- Agent service /api/ prefix for management endpoints
- shadcn/ui for components (owned code, not dependency)

### Pending Todos

1. **Fix 4 pre-existing test failures** (code quality)
2. **Run dev-agent container as non-root** (infrastructure)
3. **11 tests skipped pending infrastructure** (testing)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
